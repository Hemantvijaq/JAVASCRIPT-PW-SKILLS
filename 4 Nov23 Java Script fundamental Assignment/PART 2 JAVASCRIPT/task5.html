        <li> Programming languages have a commenting feature that allows you to document your code and 
            provide explanations in a way that humans can understand. When multiple developers collaborate on a 
            codebase, comments are helpful for clarifying the purpose of specific code section</li>
        <li> Comments can also serve as a to-do list, helping you keep track of tasks that need to be completed in 
            the future.</li>
        <li>Additionally, comments can be used to deactivate code temporarily. This is beneficial when you want to 
            test something without completely removing the code</li>
