    <ul>
        <li>During code reviews, meaningful variable names make it easier for reviewers to provide
            feedback and identify potential issues.</li>
        <li>Meaningful variable names help prevent errors caused by using the wrong variable or
            making incorrect assumptions about variable values.</li>
        <li>Descriptive variable names serve as a form of self-documentation. They convey the intent
            and context of the variable, reducing the need for additional comments.</li>
        <li>Well-named variables reduce the chances of introducing bugs when modifying or
            extending code. You're less likely to misunderstand the variable's role and make incorrect changes.</li>
