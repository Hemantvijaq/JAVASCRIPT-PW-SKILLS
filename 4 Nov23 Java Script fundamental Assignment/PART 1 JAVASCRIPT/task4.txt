presedence and associativity are two concept both the terms pllay a very vital role
in solving numeric task.


Presedence:- Precedence refers to the priority given to different operators. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before operators with lower precedence.
  
  let result = 6 + 5 * 2;//in this example, multiplication has a higher precedence than
                       addition, so 5 * 2 is evaluated first, and then the result is added to 6.
                       the result of this problem is not 22 because multiplication as higher precedence.



 Associativity:-Associativity defines the order in which operators of the same precedence are evaluated when they appear in a sequence.


let example result = 10 - 7 - 3;//In this example, the subtraction operator has left-to-right  
                         associativity, so 10 - 7 is evaluated first, and then the result is subtracted by 3.

Proper form Expressions:- Knowing the precedence ensures that expressions are evaluated in the intended order. Without this understanding, the result of an expression might be unexpected.


Predictable code:- When an expression contains multiple operators, understanding their associativity helps avoid ambiguity and determines the correct order of evaluation.


Optimized Coding:- Knowledge of operator precedence allows developers to write expressions without unnecessary parentheses, making the code more concise and readable.


Debugging:- Incorrect assumptions about precedence and associativity can lead to subtle bugs. Understanding these concepts facilitates effective debugging.
